## 🌟 Features

This isn't just a simple remake. This version includes a host of enhancements designed to create a more dynamic and enjoyable experience:

### 🎨 Visual Style (Enhanced Retro Look)

* **Distinct Snake Head:** The snake's head has a unique color and features eyes that move to indicate its direction.
* **Gradient Body:** A smooth color gradient runs down the snake's body, giving it a modern, polished look.
* **Pulsing Food:** The food item subtly pulses, making it easier to spot.
* **High-Contrast Theme:** A classic pale green and charcoal color palette that's easy on the eyes.
* **Prominent UI Text:** The score and menu titles use a larger font for better readability.

### 🎮 Gameplay & Experience

* **Classic Mechanics:** Simple, intuitive controls (arrow keys) and the core "eat and grow" gameplay loop.
* **Screen-Shake on Death:** A brief, intense screen-shake effect provides dramatic feedback when the game ends.
* **Dynamic Sound Effects:** Synthesized sounds for eating food and a dreadful, dissonant sound for game over.
* **Visual Feedback:** A quick screen flash occurs every time the snake eats.
* **Randomized Game Over Messages:** A variety of interesting messages are displayed on the game over screen to add personality.

### 🖥️ User Interface

* **Image-Based Start Screen:** Features the classic "Snake II" title image for a touch of nostalgia.
* **Interactive Menus:** Clean, highlighted menus for easy navigation and difficulty selection.
* **Three Difficulty Levels:** Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard to match your skill level.
