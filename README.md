Enhanced Python Snake Game
A modern tribute to the classic Nokia snake game, rebuilt from the ground up in Python using the pygame library. This project replicates the nostalgic feel of the original while introducing a polished, enhanced user interface and a more engaging gameplay experience.

Inspired by the classic Snake II title screen.

üåü Features
This isn't just a simple remake. This version includes a host of enhancements designed to create a more dynamic and enjoyable experience:

üé® Visual Style (Enhanced Retro Look)
Distinct Snake Head: The snake's head has a unique color and features eyes that move to indicate its direction.

Gradient Body: A smooth color gradient runs down the snake's body, giving it a modern, polished look.

Pulsing Food: The food item subtly pulses, making it easier to spot.

High-Contrast Theme: A classic pale green and charcoal color palette that's easy on the eyes.

Prominent UI Text: The score and menu titles use a larger font for better readability.

üéÆ Gameplay & Experience
Classic Mechanics: Simple, intuitive controls (arrow keys) and the core "eat and grow" gameplay loop.

Screen-Shake on Death: A brief, intense screen-shake effect provides dramatic feedback when the game ends.

Dynamic Sound Effects: Synthesized sounds for eating food and a dreadful, dissonant sound for game over.

Visual Feedback: A quick screen flash occurs every time the snake eats.

Randomized Game Over Messages: A variety of interesting messages are displayed on the game over screen to add personality.

üñ•Ô∏è User Interface
Image-Based Start Screen: Features the classic "Snake II" title image for a touch of nostalgia.

Interactive Menus: Clean, highlighted menus for easy navigation and difficulty selection.

Three Difficulty Levels: Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard to match your skill level.

Custom "Game Over" Screen: A uniquely styled game over screen with a dark red title and a bolded "ENTER" prompt.
